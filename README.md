This project is developed based on Python 3.6. 

## Install prerequisites
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Download datasets
Download the  "" [[download link]](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1vEyOsYi06-u2PF7vr-Hj4vzAqb7jX5h6) and run 'unzip dataset.zip' at the root directory before training.

# Regression experiments
All code for this part are included in "UMBD" and "ABD" subfolder. Please change to that folder before running the code.



## Running demos


### PBPFL training
* Train models with PBPFL

```
bash pbpfl_train.sh
```

### AVGFL training
* Train models with traditional AVGFL

```
bash avgfl_train.sh
```


# Classification experiments
All code for this part are included in "LDC" subfolder. Please change to that folder before running the code.
